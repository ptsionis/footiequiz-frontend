# FootieQuiz - Front-end

FootieQuiz, a real-time PvP web app, is an online quiz with football questions, in **Greek language**. A user can create a room, get a room password, and share it with a friend, who can then join the room using the specific password. This allows users to compete against each other and find out who knows more about the #1 sport in the world!

The back-end for FootieQuiz can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/ptsionis/footiequiz-backend).

##About the game

FootieQuiz consists of 18 football questions, divided in 6 categories:
- HISTORY (ΙΣΤΟΡΙΑ)
- GEOGRAPHY (ΓΕΩΓΡΑΦΙΑ)
- MISSES (ΠΟΙΟΣ ΛΕΙΠΕΙ)
- LOGO (ΛΟΓΟΤΥΠΑ)
- PLAYER ID
- HIDDEN (ΚΡΥΦΗ)

When it is a player's turn, they can choose one question of the remaining avaible, aka the questions that have not been played yet. After they click in a category, both the question and all four available answer will appear. The player can then choose one of the provided answers, and see if it was the correct or wrong answer. In case it was correct, he gets a total number of points, equal to the difficulty of the level. In case he used the Double Help and the answer was correct, he gets double the points. Finally, it is time for the opponent to play. After all 18 questions have been played, users will see who won and in which score tier they are.

Players can use the Help buttons, Double and Tip, only once. Double help can only be used before the player chooses a question, while Tip help can be used only after the player chose a question. Help lasts only for one round, and cannot be used afterwards, no matter if the player found the correct answer when the help buttons were used.

## Instructions

Below there are mentioned the basic use cases for FootieQuiz. Specifically, we will see how to create a room, join a room and start playing.

### Step 1: [FootieQuiz initial screen]

When we visit FootieQuiz url, we will see the initial screen. We have to press the Start button (ΕΝΑΡΞΗ).

### Step 2.1: [Create a room]

User can create a room, after passing the reCAPTCHA test, by clicking on the Create Room button (ΔΗΜΙΟΥΡΓΙΑ ΔΩΜΑΤΙΟΥ). Usually, we have to wait around 30 seconds in order to get a room password. After getting a room id, we can share it to someone else, so they can use it to join our room and start playing.

### Step 2.2: [Join a room]
If someone else created a room and shared the room password with us, we can join them, after passing the reCAPTCHA test, by clicking on the Join Room button (ΕΙΣΟΔΟΣ ΣΕ ΔΩΜΑΤΙΟ). We have to paste the room password and then press Enter (ΕΙΣΟΔΟΣ) and start playing.

### Step 3: [Play the game]
If everything worked properly, the game should start, and both players should see the game main screen. FootieQuiz chooses randomly which player will start first. Depending on whether it is our turn or not, we will see a message above all questions, which will say PLAYING (ΠΑΙΖΕΤΕ) or PLEASE WAIT (ΠΑΡΑΚΑΛΩ ΠΕΡΙΜΕΝΕΤΕ). Also, the user who has to wait, will have all of its buttons disabled, in contrast with the user that is currently playing, who will have all of the buttons enabled, except for the questions that have already been played.
